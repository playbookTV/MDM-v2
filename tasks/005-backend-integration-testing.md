# TASK-005: Backend Integration and Testing

## Requirements Analysis
The React web application frontend is complete with all four core pages implemented. The next critical requirement is to ensure the frontend properly integrates with the FastAPI backend and functions as a complete system.

## Problem Analysis
The current React application contains comprehensive UI components and hooks, but relies on API endpoints that may not be fully implemented or tested. We need to validate the complete data flow from frontend to backend to database.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Integration Testing with Mock Backend
- Create comprehensive mock API responses
- Test all frontend workflows in isolation
- Pros: Fast iteration, no backend dependencies
- Cons: May miss real integration issues

### Option 2: End-to-End Backend Integration
- Implement missing backend endpoints
- Test complete data flow from React → FastAPI → Supabase
- Pros: Real integration validation, production-ready
- Cons: More complex, requires backend work

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach with Validation
- Test existing backend endpoints
- Implement critical missing endpoints
- Create integration test suite
- Pros: Balanced approach, focuses on critical paths
- Cons: Medium complexity

## Selected Solution: Option 3 - Hybrid Approach with Validation

This provides the best balance of thorough testing while focusing on the most critical integration points.

## Implementation Contract

### Deliverables
1. **Backend Endpoint Validation**
   - Test all API endpoints used by React hooks
   - Identify missing or incomplete endpoints
   - Document API response formats

2. **Critical Endpoint Implementation** 
   - Implement missing endpoints for core workflows
   - Focus on dataset upload, job monitoring, scene review
   - Ensure proper error handling and validation

3. **Integration Test Suite**
   - Create automated tests for key user workflows
   - Test complete data flow paths
   - Validate error handling and edge cases

4. **Environment Configuration**
   - Set up proper environment variables
   - Configure CORS for frontend-backend communication
   - Set up development database seeding

### Technical Requirements
- All React Query hooks must successfully connect to backend
- Upload workflow must work end-to-end (React → FastAPI → R2 → Supabase)
- Real-time updates must function (job status, scene processing)
- Error states must be properly handled and displayed
- Authentication and authorization (if required)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All 4 main pages load without API errors
- [ ] Dataset upload completes successfully 
- [ ] Job monitoring shows real-time updates
- [ ] Scene review workflow functions completely
- [ ] Error handling displays appropriate messages
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (<2s initial load)

### Dependencies
- FastAPI backend running on localhost:8000
- Supabase database with proper schema
- Cloudflare R2 storage configured
- Sample test data available

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Backend Endpoint Audit
1. Test existing FastAPI endpoints against React hook expectations
2. Document any missing endpoints or response format mismatches
3. Create comprehensive API specification

### Phase 2: Critical Endpoint Implementation  
1. Implement missing dataset and upload endpoints
2. Add job monitoring and control endpoints
3. Implement scene review and annotation endpoints
4. Add proper authentication/authorization

### Phase 3: Integration Testing
1. Create test suite for key user workflows
2. Set up automated testing environment
3. Test error handling and edge cases
4. Performance testing and optimization

### Phase 4: Documentation and Deployment Prep
1. Update API documentation
2. Create deployment configuration
3. Set up environment variable templates
4. Create developer setup guide

This task will ensure the React frontend functions as a complete, production-ready system integrated with the backend infrastructure.
