## TASK-002
---
STATUS: CLOSED

Implement JobsPage component with comprehensive job monitoring capabilities:
- Input: React functional component props (none initially)
- Output: JSX.Element rendering the job monitoring interface
- Preconditions:
  - FastAPI backend running with /api/v1/jobs endpoints
  - Redis queue system operational for background processing
  - Dataset Explorer Page completed (TASK-001)
- Postconditions:
  - User can view all processing jobs with real-time status updates
  - User can start new processing jobs for uploaded datasets
  - User can cancel running jobs and retry failed jobs
  - Job progress is displayed with detailed metrics and logs
- Invariants:
  - Job status updates reflect actual backend state
  - UI remains responsive during long-running job operations
  - Job metrics are accurate and real-time
- Error handling:
  - Network failures → show reconnection status with retry
  - Job failures → display error details with stack traces
  - API errors → graceful degradation with error messages
  - WebSocket disconnections → automatic reconnection logic
- Performance: Handle monitoring of 100+ concurrent jobs efficiently
- Thread safety: React concurrent features compatible with real-time updates

Generate the implementation with real-time job monitoring using WebSocket connections or polling.
Include comprehensive job management actions (start, cancel, retry, view logs).
Add detailed progress visualization with charts and metrics.
Integrate with existing dataset management workflow.

Environment assumptions:
- Runtime: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- Frameworks/libs: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI, React Query, WebSocket (optional)
- Integration points: FastAPI backend at /api/v1/jobs, Redis queue status
- Determinism: Predictable job state transitions, consistent progress reporting

Test cases that MUST pass:
1. Empty jobs state renders with "Start Processing" call-to-action
2. Active job displays with real-time progress updates and ETA
3. Failed job shows error details and retry functionality
4. Job cancellation immediately updates status and stops progress
5. Job logs stream in real-time with syntax highlighting
6. Bulk job operations (start multiple, cancel all) work correctly

File changes:
- Create: src/pages/JobsPage.tsx
- Create: src/components/jobs/JobCard.tsx
- Create: src/components/jobs/JobProgressChart.tsx
- Create: src/components/jobs/JobLogsModal.tsx
- Create: src/components/jobs/StartJobModal.tsx
- Create: src/types/job.ts (extend existing dataset types)
- Create: src/hooks/useJobs.ts
- Create: src/hooks/useJobLogs.ts
- Modify: src/App.tsx (add /jobs route)
- Avoid changes to: backend job processing logic

Observability:
- Log job state transitions and user actions
- Track job completion rates and failure patterns
- Monitor real-time update performance and WebSocket health
- Error boundary for job monitoring crashes

Safeguards:
- Enforce YAGNI: only implement features from DXD Jobs Page spec
- Rate limiting for job status polling to prevent API overload
- Graceful degradation when real-time features unavailable
- Prevent accidental job cancellations with confirmation dialogs
- Memory leak prevention for long-running job monitoring sessions
