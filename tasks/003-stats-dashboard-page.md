## TASK-003
---
STATUS: OPEN

Implement StatsDashboardPage component with comprehensive analytics and system metrics:
- Input: React functional component props (none initially)
- Output: JSX.Element rendering the analytics dashboard interface
- Preconditions:
  - FastAPI backend running with /api/v1/stats endpoints
  - Dataset Explorer and Jobs Page completed (TASK-001, TASK-002)
  - Active dataset processing generating metrics
- Postconditions:
  - User can view system-wide performance metrics and trends
  - User can analyze dataset processing success rates and bottlenecks
  - User can monitor AI model performance across different scene types
  - Charts and visualizations update in real-time with processing data
- Invariants:
  - Dashboard metrics reflect accurate system state
  - Charts remain performant with large datasets
  - Time-based aggregations are consistent and reliable
- Error handling:
  - Network failures → show cached data with staleness indicator
  - Missing data → graceful degradation with placeholder charts
  - API errors → partial dashboard functionality with error boundaries
- Performance: Efficiently render 10,000+ data points across multiple charts
- Thread safety: React concurrent features compatible with real-time updates

Generate the implementation with interactive data visualizations using charts library.
Include system health monitoring, processing performance analytics, and AI model metrics.
Add time range selection and metric drill-down capabilities.
Integrate with existing job and dataset management workflow.

Environment assumptions:
- Runtime: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- Frameworks/libs: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI, React Query, Chart.js/Recharts
- Integration points: FastAPI backend at /api/v1/stats, existing job/dataset APIs
- Determinism: Consistent metric calculations, reliable time-series aggregation

Test cases that MUST pass:
1. Empty state renders with placeholder charts and "No data" indicators
2. System metrics (CPU, memory, processing rate) display with real-time updates
3. Dataset processing charts show success/failure rates over time
4. AI model performance metrics display confidence distributions
5. Time range selector filters all charts consistently
6. Chart interactions (hover, zoom, drill-down) work smoothly

File changes:
- Create: src/pages/StatsDashboardPage.tsx
- Create: src/components/dashboard/SystemHealthCard.tsx
- Create: src/components/dashboard/ProcessingMetricsChart.tsx
- Create: src/components/dashboard/ModelPerformanceChart.tsx
- Create: src/components/dashboard/DatasetStatsTable.tsx
- Create: src/components/dashboard/TimeRangeSelector.tsx
- Create: src/types/stats.ts
- Create: src/hooks/useStats.ts
- Modify: src/App.tsx (add /dashboard route)
- Add: recharts dependency to package.json

Observability:
- Log chart rendering performance and data loading times
- Track user interactions with dashboard filters and time ranges
- Monitor real-time update frequency and data staleness
- Error boundary for dashboard component failures

Safeguards:
- Enforce YAGNI: only implement features from DXD Dashboard spec
- Optimize chart rendering for large datasets with data sampling
- Graceful handling of missing or incomplete metrics
- Rate limiting for stats API calls to prevent overload
- Memory-efficient chart updates without full re-renders
