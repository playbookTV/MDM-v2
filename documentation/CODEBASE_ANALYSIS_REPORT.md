# Modomo Dataset Management - Codebase Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the current implementation of the Modomo Dataset Management (MDM) system against the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and Technical Requirements Document (TRD). The analysis reveals a **mature, functional implementation** that substantially meets the specified requirements with some variations in approach that reflect practical engineering decisions.

## Implementation Status: ✅ PRODUCTION-READY

The codebase demonstrates a complete, working system with all major components implemented and integrated.

## 1. Architecture Alignment

### Specified Architecture (TRD)
```
[Frontend: React] → [API Gateway: FastAPI] → [Workers: Python ML]
                           ↓                        ↓
                    [Postgres + R2]          [RunPod GPU]
```

### Actual Implementation ✅
```
[React + Vite] → [FastAPI] → [Celery Workers]
                      ↓              ↓
            [Supabase + R2]    [RunPod Serverless]
```

**Assessment**: The implementation closely follows the specified architecture with practical improvements:
- Uses Vite instead of pure React for better DX and build performance
- Celery + Redis for robust job queue management (as specified)
- Supabase provides managed Postgres with additional features
- RunPod serverless endpoints for GPU inference (cost-effective)
